# flutter_rust_bridge codegen runner

# Generates Dart bindings from crates/termex-flutter-bridge/src/api/*.rs
# into app/lib/src/frb_generated/.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Rust toolchain (stable)
#   - Flutter SDK (>= 3.24)
#   - flutter_rust_bridge_codegen (cargo install --version '^2.0')
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/frb-codegen.sh          # regenerate bindings
#   ./scripts/frb-codegen.sh --check  # verify current bindings are up-to-date (CI)
